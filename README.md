# Exodus Data Management Service

### Documentation

All documentation has been moved to the wiki:  [Exodus Documentation](https://github.com/Soverance/Exodus/wiki)

The Exodus project was born from my desire to have a backup solution for Soverance data that met the following requirements:

* Easy to use - I wanted the backup process to be fully automated and require little effort.
* Full scope - I wanted the backup process to encompass the entire Soverance environment and all of the critical data contained within.
* Free and secure - I wanted the backup process to utilize native, built-in methods for moving data around the network in order to minimize cost, improve security, and reduce dependencies on third parties.
* Open source - I wanted the software to be open source, to provide transparancy, security, and community involvement.
