### Documentation

All documentation has been moved to the wiki:  [Exodus Documentation](https://github.com/Soverance/Exodus/wiki)

The Exodus project was born from my desire to have what I call a "**one-touch ad-hoc**" backup process of all our critical data at Soverance Studios. This project would have to meet the following requirements:

* Designed for Small Business - I wanted it to be familiar to install and manage in a Microsoft-based corporate domain network
* Easy to use - I wanted the backup process to be fully automated and require little effort.
* Full scope - I wanted the backup process to encompass the complete environment of the average small business, and all of the critical data contained within.
* Free and secure - I wanted the backup process to utilize native, built-in methods for moving data around the network in order to minimize cost, improve security, and reduce dependencies on third parties.
* Open source - I wanted the software to be open source, in order to provide transparancy, security, and community involvement.
